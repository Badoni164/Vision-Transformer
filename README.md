#Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification

Description: Undertook a comprehensive project to develop a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification tasks during a 2-month internship. This project involved building a customizable ViT architecture from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras. The model was trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a standard benchmark for image classification.

Key Technologies: TensorFlow, Keras, Python

Responsibilities:

Architecture Design: Designed and implemented a flexible Vision Transformer architecture that allows customization of several parameters, including patch size, number of patches, projection dimension, number of attention heads, number of transformer layers, transformer units, and MLP units.
Technical Issue Resolution: Identified and resolved critical issues in the model architecture, such as the mismatch in the number of patches defined versus computed and errors in the MultiHeadAttention layer. This included correcting the connection of attention_output to ensure accurate attention mechanisms.
Data Preprocessing: Executed thorough data loading and preprocessing steps, which included resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting the data into training and testing sets to ensure efficient model training.
Patch Encoding: Implemented patch encoding mechanisms to divide images into smaller patches and encode these patches into linear embeddings, which serve as the input to the transformer model.
Model Training: Trained the Vision Transformer model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, leveraging TensorFlow's capabilities to handle large-scale data and complex model training. Applied techniques to monitor training progress, adjust learning rates, and prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation and Optimization: Conducted a rigorous evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Performed hyperparameter tuning and model optimization to enhance classification accuracy and overall model performance.
Documentation and Reporting: Documented the entire project workflow, including the model architecture, training process, encountered challenges, and their solutions. Presented the project outcomes, insights, and future work recommendations to the internship supervisor and team.
Outcome: Successfully developed and optimized a Vision Transformer model capable of classifying images with high accuracy. Demonstrated strong proficiency in deep learning, computer vision, and TensorFlow, contributing to the advancement of image classification techniques. This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also provided valuable experience in addressing real-world machine learning challenges and refining complex model architectures.
